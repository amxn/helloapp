	<p><span class="read">The idea is fairly simple: When you arrive at the conference, you simply say which seat you're sitting in via Twitter.</span></p>
    
	<p><span class="read">You can then browse the seating chart and see who is sitting around you, what their interests are, and whether you have anything in common. You can also search the audience for specific names or skillsets (php, designer, CSS3, etc).</span></p>
