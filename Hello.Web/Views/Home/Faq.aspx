    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

	<p><span class="read">The idea is fairly simple: When you arrive at the conference, you simply say which seat you're sitting in via Twitter.</span></p>
    
	<p><span class="read">You can then browse the seating chart and see who is sitting around you, what their interests are, and whether you have anything in common. You can also search the audience for specific names or skillsets (php, designer, CSS3, etc).</span></p>

    <h3 id="points-badges">Earn points and badges</h3>

	<p><span class="read">The more people you meet and special tasks you complete during the conference, the more points and "badges" you'll be awarded. If you earn a high enough rank, you'll be able to post public messages to the entire audience and win awesome prizes.</span></p>

    <p><span class="read">When you meet someone, and they really like you, they can award you a "High Five", which awards you a special badge and gives you <%= Settings.Points.HiFive %> points.</span></p>

    <h3 id="instructions1">Instructions</h3>

	<h4 id="instructionscheckin">Checking in and grabbing your seat</h4>

	<p><span class="read">Once you've sat down, there will be a passcode attached to your seat. <strong>Important:</strong> At the beginning of each session in the conference schedule, the seating chart is wiped clean and you'll need to re-checkin.

		and choose three tags for yourself. You can change your category and tags by just re-checking in.</span><br><code>@helloapp hello !des #ux #html5 #movies</code><br><code>@helloapp hello !dev #php #django #mysql</code><br><code>@helloapp hello !biz #ideas #fun #music</code></p>
		
		<h4>Getting points and meeting people</h4>

		<p><span class="read">When you meet someone and they give you their Twitter username, just tweet:</span><br><code>@helloapp met @their-username</code></p>
		
		<p><span class="read">If they return the favour and tweet:</span><br><code>@helloapp met @your-username</code></p>
		
		<p><span class="read">then you'll both get 10 points for meeting each other. Both people have to do it, in order for the points to be awarded.</span></p>
